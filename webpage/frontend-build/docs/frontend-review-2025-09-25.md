# Frontend Verification Report — 2025-09-25 (Preview)

## 1. Scope & Objectives
- Verify the task lifecycle experience (pre-deduct → commit → cancel/retry) now exposed via `TaskLifecycleControls` and backed by `useTaskLifecycle` + platform API wrappers.
- Regress the live task feed (SSE mock + analytics) to ensure the new lifecycle surface does not break existing telemetry.
- Confirm landing experience (Hero, Monetization path, Template grid, Compliance banners) remains aligned with design tokens and mock data utilities.

## 2. Latest Build Snapshot
- Build/Tests: `npm run test` → **47 passing specs** (lib API suites + component suites + lifecycle workflow tests).
- Key components touched this cycle: `src/hooks/useTaskLifecycle.ts`, `src/components/TaskLifecycleControls.tsx`, `src/components/TaskCenterPanel.tsx`.
- Dependencies: no runtime updates; still targeting Next.js app with mock backend adapters.

## 3. Automated Coverage Summary
| Area | Tests | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credits lifecycle workflows | `src/lib/workflows/taskLifecycle.test.ts` | Validates hold/commit/cancel/retry helpers, refund deltas, and error suppression (404/409). |
| UI lifecycle controls | `src/components/__tests__/TaskLifecycleControls.test.tsx` | Exercises CTA hooks and analytics instrumentation, ensuring hold/commit invoke helpers with correct payloads. |
| Task center regression | `src/components/__tests__/TaskCenterPanel.test.tsx` | Confirms event tracking & simulate CTA unchanged; lifecycle controls mocked to isolate feed behaviour. |
| API client | `src/lib/api/index.test.ts`, `src/lib/api/platformClient.test.ts` | Authorisation headers, retry metadata, SSE fallbacks already passing. |
| Landing modules | Hero/Monetization/TemplateGrid/TopNavigation suites | No regressions detected. |

> Pending: integrate coverage instrumentation (Istanbul) if percentage metrics are required for release sign-off.

## 4. Manual Spot Checks
- ✅ Verified Task Lifecycle Controls render inside Task Center and show status transitions (idle → holding → committing) using mock data.
- ✅ Confirmed analytics events still fire for stream status, lifecycle actions, and CTA interactions (via vitest console output & manual session run).
- ✅ Quick UI sweep on landing sections for layout regressions (desktop viewport).
- ⚠️ Mobile breakpoints not yet exercised; add responsive audit (Task Lifecycle panel needs narrow screen behaviour review).

## 5. Known Gaps & Risks
- SSE remains backed by mock config; once platform exposes real endpoints, revisit retry/backoff + auth token handling.
- Lifecycle helpers assume synchronous success; add integration/e2e tests when backend ready (e.g. `hold_insufficient`, `pre_deduct_already_processed`).
- No Storybook/visual regression harness yet; recommend adding Chromatic (or similar) pre-release.
- Accessibility sweep outstanding for new controls (aria-live for status, focus states, button grouping).

## 6. Action Items before 2025-09-25 Report Finalisation
1. Run responsive + accessibility pass on Task Center & lifecycle controls.
2. Pair with platform-integration once live SSE URL/token delivered; add `.env` plumbing and update `platformClient` defaults.
3. Capture Lighthouse snapshot (desktop & mobile) to confirm performance unchanged after lifecycle additions.
4. Draft risk matrix & mitigation summary (backend availability, auth dependencies) for the final report.

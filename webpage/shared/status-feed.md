# Coordination Status Log

## Usage
- Business Experience and Platform Delivery summarize cross-team progress in their respective rows; the shared row keeps the consolidated log.
- If there is no update, duplicate the template row and fill "None" where appropriate.
- Columns:
  - Complete: finished items and impacted modules.
  - Blockers: outstanding issues; write "None" if clear.
  - Next Step: planned follow-up.
  - Owner: default `<group>-Codex`, e.g., `BX-Codex`.
